Open source community, being socialist-minded, is known to react dismissively at cases of copyright infringement. FOSS people were going as far as calling me "asshole" for pointing these issues. And still I have collected a few facts of illegal appropriation of intellectual property by FOSS community.

Open source developers rarely check the source of the assets. For example, several open source games appear to be using sounds from http://free-loops.com/pd-loops-1.html which is  full of illegal content, like the sounds taken from Sound Ideas (http://free-loops.com/2975-9mm-shotgun.html), Godzilla movies (http://free-loops.com/3006-godzilla.html) or Warcraft 2 (http://free-loops.com/3010-horse.html http://free-loops.com/3009-hello.html).

- OpenLieroX (https://github.com/albertz/openlierox/tree/0.59/share/gamedir): communism allows them to "borrow" assets from Naruto, Doom and WH40k, then re-release these assets under GPL

- Wesnoth: wanderer.ogg is a variation on Betrayal at Krondor main theme

- Pingus: data/images/special/pacman -- graphics from Namco's game

- Fish Fillets: soundtrack from X-Files (TV series). Graphics and sounds from Warcraft 2.

- Stendhal: steals sounds from warcraft 2 (arrow-1.ogg) and half of its graphics come from enterbrain's RPGMaker (for example, sandy_rocks.png, oak_tree.png, maple_tree.png, locust_tree.png, pine_tree.png, snow_on_pine.png, ship.png, object/ship.png, tan_tent.png). Also pacman.png

- Crossfire is known to infringe on sprites from Starcraft (archon sprite) and Dark Legions (demon, greater demon, likely found at http://www.galaraf.net/ANIGIFS/demons/index.htm) and Final Fantasy VI (giant worm - http://crossfire.real-time.com/spoiler/monsters/monsters_e_to_h.html). Bear comes from (http://www.galaraf.net/ANIGIFS/bears/index.htm) and rat (http://www.animatedimages.org/img-animated-rat-image-0011-111229.htm) come from some non-free sources too.

- Daimonin: used beholder and a few other sprites from SSI Gold Box games

- Egoboo: Most of Egoboo's sound samples are stolen I.e. from Baldur's Gate (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egoboo/egoboo-assets/master/basicdat/stealth.ogg), from the soundtrack to Indiana Jones movie (https://github.com/egoboo/egoboo-assets/blob/master/modules/archaeologist.mod/objects/bouldertrap.obj/sound2.wav). A lot of others Egoboo sounds appear to be coming from Sound Ideas.

S.C.O.U.R.G.E. (https://sourceforge.net/projects/scourge/): 3d models based of movies (i.e. Alien, Blade, etc..) and games like Id Software's Doom 

- Runesword 2: later releases infringe on graphics from Age of empires and Majesty
