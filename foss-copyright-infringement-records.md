Open source community, being socialist-minded, is known to react dismissively at cases of copyright infringement. FOSS people were going as far as calling me "asshole" for pointing these issues. And still I have collected a few facts of illegal appropriation of intellectual property by FOSS community.

- Wesnoth: wanderer.ogg is a variation on Betrayal at Krondor main theme

- Pingus: data/images/special/pacman -- graphics from Namco's game

- Fish Fillets: soundtrack from X-Files (TV series). Graphics and sounds from Warcraft 2.

- Stendhal: steals sounds from warcraft 2 (arrow-1.ogg) and half of its graphics come from enterbrain's RPGMaker (for example, sandy_rocks.png, oak_tree.png, maple_tree.png, locust_tree.png, pine_tree.png, snow_on_pine.png, ship.png, object/ship.png, tan_tent.png). Also pacman.png

- Crossfire is known to infringe on sprites from Starcraft (archon sprite) and Dark Legions (demon, greater demon, likely found at http://www.galaraf.net/ANIGIFS/demons/index.htm) and Final Fantasy VI (giant worm - http://crossfire.real-time.com/spoiler/monsters/monsters_e_to_h.html). Bear comes from (http://www.galaraf.net/ANIGIFS/bears/index.htm) and rat (http://www.animatedimages.org/img-animated-rat-image-0011-111229.htm) come from some non-free sources too.

- Daimonin: used beholder and a few other sprites from SSI Gold Box games

- Egoboo: Most of Egoboo's sound samples are stolen I.e. from Baldur's Gate (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egoboo/egoboo-assets/master/basicdat/stealth.ogg), from the soundtrack to Indiana Jones movie (https://github.com/egoboo/egoboo-assets/blob/master/modules/archaeologist.mod/objects/bouldertrap.obj/sound2.wav). A lot of others Egoboo sounds appear to be coming from Sound Ideas.

- Runesword 2: later releases infringe on graphics from Age of empires and Majesty
